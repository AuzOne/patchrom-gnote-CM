62c2496 Kernel makefiles that the stat on the system is GNU stat. GNU stat uses the "-c" option to specify format. Darwin stat uses the "-f" option to specify format. This discrepency will cause kernel build breaks. On my system, I symlink stat to GNU stat. This causes the "get-file-size" define to fail. The fix for this is to detect "gstat", aka GNU stat, and use that appropriately.

971073b Revert "Rework the retain-release.m test to use FileCheck and the "text" output"
2ab012a Fix off-by-one bug in diagnostic prose of ObjCContainersASTChecker. While the check itself should count 0-based for the parameter index, the diagnostic should be 1-based (first, second, third, not start at 0).
62bde3e ExplodedGraph::shouldCollectNode() should not collect nodes for non-Expr Stmts (as this previously was the case before this was refactored).  We also shouldn't need to specially handle BinaryOperators since the eagerly-assume heuristic tags such nodes.
689268a Rework the retain-release.m test to use FileCheck and the "text" output of the analyzer, as the RetainReleaseChecker has many fine-grain path diagnostic events that were not being checked.  This uncovered an inconsistency between the path diagnostics between Objective-C and Objective-C++ code in ConditionBRVisitor that was fixed in a recent patch.
c47dc1b Fix bug in ConditionBRVisitor where for C++ (and not C) we were not ignoring implicit pointer-to-boolean conversions in condition expressions.  This would result in inconsistent diagnostic emission between C and C++.
6964b3f PR9023: A template template parameter whose template parameter list contains an unexpanded parameter pack is a pack expansion. Thus, as with a non-type template parameter which is a pack expansion, it needs to be expanded early into a fixed list of template parameters.

a6c66ce Change the representation of builtin functions in the AST (__builtin_* etc.) so that it isn't possible to take their address. Specifically, introduce a new type to represent a reference to a builtin function, and a new cast kind to convert it to a function pointer in the operand of a call.  Fixes PR13195.

9617130 objective-C: clang must implicitly convert __objc_yes/__objc_no to (BOOL)1/(BOOL)0 when BOOL is declared; otherwise it resorts to default of 'signed char'. This is important to selecting the correct Numeric API numberWithBool: Can't have a clang test for this. Will checkin and executable llvm test. // rdar://12156616

9d7008e Previous libusbx fix was a red herring of sorts. Inadvertedly it did fix the issue. However, the correct solution was much simpler: https://github.com/libusbx/libusbx/pull/80
fec8bbc Actually fixed the bug (race condition) in libusbx-1.0 this time! Source available at https://github.com/libusbx/libusbx/pull/79
1d2927b Added a patched version of libusbx that fixes device claiming on Windows. Changes to libusbx are documented here: https://github.com/libusbx/libusbx/issues/78
8c6b20a - Incrementing to 1.4 RC2. - Fixed Release xcopy command that was referring to libusb instead of   libusbx.
5212bf5 Added libusbx-1.0 library and DLL missed due to .gitignore
7caa014 Added Galaxy Camera download mode identifier (apparently).
4d850a2 - Updated MSVC projects to MSVC2012. - Changed from libusb-1.0 to libusbx. - Upgraded to C++11 (defined as C++0x for backwards compatibility with gcc < 4.7).
31b1b0b - Changed interpretation of packet size reponses of 0 from meaning "don't   care" to "unsupported". - Changed block size in libpit to mean either block size or block offset.
e0e84b2 Fixed --repartition flag parsing bug.
8734112 Turns out udev ATTR{idProduct} really is case sensitive.
7a8f813 Made Heimdall Frontend pass the --verbose parameter for all actions when 'Verbose Output' is checked.
648bfb1 Added a Qt4VSPropertySheet.props file that will hopefully work for other people.
8ac7412 PIT files are no longer always exactly 4096 bytes. Fixed a bug that was a result of making this assumption.
4f32206 Added missing reference& in heimdall/source/Arguments.cpp
4994531 Made Qt project (qmake) configurable using environment variables on OS X. Also added a missing &reference symbol in heimdall/source/Arguments.h
2826991 Added fixed for g++ parsing issue on OS X.
6cd6b35 Heimdall 1.4 RC1:     - Massive refactoring.     - Support for Qualcomm based devices.     - Print PIT from file.     - Use partition names as arguments e.g. --HIDDEN, --KERNEL, --MOVINAND etc.     - Heimdall Frontend UI improvements.     - And much more...

aac6c7f On some handsets, there is a configuration of hardware that causes a conflict with HCE.  Primarily it is something in the SWP configuration with a SWP sim card.  It appears to be a PN544 register setting that blocks HCE type A only from initialization.  This patch checks for this conflict and disables HCE for those configurations.  The better way would be to understand how to set the PN544 registers to unblock the conflict, but this is a sufficient work around for this minority of configurations

3d5e161 Fixed the DAG combiner to better handle the folding of AND nodes for vector types.

2e2efd9 Generic Bypass Slow Div - CodeGenPrepare pass for identifying div/rem ops - Backend specifies the type mapping using addBypassSlowDivType - Enabled only for Intel Atom with O2 32-bit -> 8-bit - Replace IDIV with instructions which test its value and use DIVB if the value is positive and less than 256. - In the case when the quotient and remainder of a divide are used a DIV and a REM instruction will be present in the IR. In the non-Atom case they are both lowered to IDIVs and CSE removes the redundant IDIV instruction, using the quotient and remainder from the first IDIV. However, due to this optimization CSE is not able to eliminate redundant IDIV instructions because they are located in different basic blocks. This is overcome by calculating both the quotient (DIV) and remainder (REM) in each basic block that is inserted by the optimization and reusing the result values when a subsequent DIV or REM instruction uses the same operands. - Test cases check for the presents of the optimization when calculating either the quotient, remainder,  or both.

e757f00 Currently targets that do not support selects with scalar conditions and vector operands - scalarize the code. ARM is such a target because it does not support CMOV of vectors. To implement this efficientlyi, we broadcast the condition bit and use a sequence of NAND-OR to select between the two operands. This is the same sequence we use for targets that don't have vector BLENDs (like SSE2).

b7ba9af CMStats changes. Remove the notification on boot. Users are thinking they need to opt out to get rid of the notification. The setting to opt-out still exists in the Settings app. If the user does not opt out within 'tFrame' time (1 day), the checkin service will now run; prior to this, the checkin service would not run until the next reboot. That next reboot could occur within a few minutes (startup crash, which then automatically checks in before the user has a chance to opt out) or even the possibility of never. This is unpredictable and buggy. Change the checkin frequency from 7 days to 1 day.

bd404d2 squisher: force hardlink.
47a84b2 squisher: link the target $OUTFILE.
6ed2e1b squisher: Get rid of it. The pngcrush tool does not add any noticeable value any more, such that it justifies the extra build time: 240MB vs 238MB. The build.prop changes are now no ops, since the key for ro.kernel.android.checkjni no longer exists. Changing the ro.build.type from eng to user is also a no op, since CM is now userdebug. Deleting bins is also unncessary now. Stripping modules is also unnecessary now. (plenty of space)
